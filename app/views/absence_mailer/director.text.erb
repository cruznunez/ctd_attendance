Hello Director,

You are receiving this email because <%= pluralize @students.size, 'student' %> in <%= @semester.course.name %> - <%= @semester.name %> <%= @students.size == 1 ? 'was' : 'were' %> absent in yesterday's class. You must do something about this. Do it.

The students are:

<% @students.each do |student| %>
  - <%= student.name %>
<% end %>

Their emails are: <%= @students.map(&:email).join(', ') %>
